	<p><b><u>API for Dialogue Adventure Game</u></b></p>
    - Our API library is designed to support game developers to design their dialogue games conveniently and fast. They basically neednâ€™t make any modifications to the MyGame template which we provide. <br>

    - We support the automatic drawing of the dialogue system. We also enable game developers to provide different options for the game players. When players choose different options, the story can flow in different directions, hero attributes can be changed, or some special effect will happen.<br>
    
    - All the work for the game developers is only to provide the picture resources in a JSON file. In this way, we humongously decrease the hardness to design a dialogue system. And the game developers can put most of their energy into writing the story, which is the core of this type of game.<br>

	<p><b><u>Summary</u></b></p>
    - This API library is designed to support the dialgoues system. It enables the game developer to draw dialogue boxes, characters, and dialogue content quickly. Moreover, it provides drawing options for options. When game players click different options, the game can flow in different directions, the hero attributes can be changed, or some special effect will happen. <br>

    - This API makes the development of a dialogue adventure game very simple. The game developer almost needs to write very little code. They can focus on finding the picture resources and writing the JSON file, which is the core of their games. <br>
    
    - In addition, this API library can also integrate with other API libraries well, like the Particle System API library, Weather System API library, and other systems. The game developers can simple import our library and call the functions to draw the dialogues and options directly. Both version 1.0 and version 2.0 can be called in the above two ways.<br>
