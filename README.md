# Project Purpose
Our API library is designed to support game developers to design their dialogue games conveniently and fast. They basically neednâ€™t make any modifications to the MyGame template which we provide. 

We support the automatic drawing of the dialogue system. We also enable game developers to provide different options for the game players. When players choose different options, the story can flow in different directions, hero attributes can be changed, or some special effect will happen.

All the work for the game developers is only to provide the picture resources in a JSON file. In this way, we humongously decrease the hardness to design a dialogue system. And the game developers can put most of their energy into writing the story, which is the core of this type of game.
